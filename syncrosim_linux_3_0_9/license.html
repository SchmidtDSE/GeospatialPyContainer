    restricted rights legends, proprietary markings and the like exactly  as
    they appear on the copy of the Software originally provided to You. No other
    rights in the Software are granted to You.

<p>
    2.2. <u>Reservation of Rights</u>. The Software and Documentation are
    licensed, not sold. ApexRMS and  its licensors own and shall retain all

    that the Software may include licensing technology, measures to  prevent
    activating the Software on more than one physical or virtual computer,  and
    other security measures designed to limit usage of the Software to that

    source code or object code form,  including without limitation, the specific
    design, structure and logic of  individual programs, their interactions both
    internal and external, and the  programming techniques employed therein are
    considered confidential and trade  secrets of ApexRMS and/or its licensors
    (the "<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”), the unauthorized

    not use such Confidential Information except to the extent  necessary to
    exercise the rights granted to Customer under this License  Agreement. For
    greater certainty, Customer shall not disclose any performance,
    benchmarking, or feature-related information about the Software. Customer
    further agree not to disclose, transfer or otherwise provide to any third
    party  any portion of the Software, Documentation or Confidential

    Customer's own  information of a similar nature, and in any event, shall use
    reasonable efforts  to prevent the disclosure of Confidential Information to
    any third parties.  This confidentiality obligation shall continue to apply
    to the Confidential  Information following the termination hereof, provided
    that the confidentiality  provisions contained herein shall not apply to
    Confidential Information which  (i) was known by Customer prior to
    disclosure, as evidenced by its business  records; (ii) was lawfully in the
    public domain prior to its disclosure, or  becomes publicly available other
    than through a breach of the confidentiality  provisions contained herein;
    (iii) was disclosed to Customer by a third party,  provided such third party
    or any other party from whom such third party  receives such information is
    not in breach of any confidentiality obligation in  respect of such
    information; or (iv) is disclosed when such disclosure is  compelled
    pursuant to legal, judicial, or administrative proceeding, or otherwise

    receive any Support Services in  respect of the Community Version. Such
    Updates and other Support Services, if  available, may be purchased
    separately from ApexRMS pursuant to an Order Form  for Support Services. Any
    such Updates or enhancements shall be considered part  of the Software and
    shall be governed by the terms and conditions of this  License Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    5.2. <u>Professional Version</u>. Support

</p>
<p>
    6. <strong><u>Fees and Payment Terms</u></strong>.
</p>
<p>
    6.1. <u>Fees</u>. You shall pay all Fees specified in each Order Form. All
    Fees are  quoted and payable in the currency specified in the Order Form.
    Except as  otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, Fees are based on
    Subscriptions  purchased and not actual usage, payment obligations are
    non-cancellable, Fees  paid are non-refundable, and the number of
    Subscriptions purchased cannot be  decreased during the relevant
    Subscription Term stated in an Order Form.  Maintenance Fees are payable
    yearly, in advance of, and in any event no later  than the anniversary date
    of the Order Form under which the Software was  ordered by Customer. The
    Community Version is available without entering into  an Order Form and no
    License Fees are payable in respect of the Community  Version.
</p>
<p>
    6.2. <u>Invoicing and Payment</u>. Fees for Subscriptions will be invoiced
    in advance and otherwise  in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless
    otherwise stated in the  Order Form, charges are due net thirty (30) days
    from the invoice date.  Customer is responsible for maintaining complete and
    accurate billing and  contact information with ApexRMS.
</p>
<p>
    6.3. <u>Overdue Charges</u>. Any payment not received from Customer by the
    due date may accrue  (except with respect to charges then subject to a

    the rate of 1.5% of the  outstanding balance per month (19.57% per annum),
    or the maximum rate permitted  by law, whichever is lower, from the date
    such payment was due until the date  paid.
</p>
<p>
    6.4. <u>Taxes</u>. Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar
    governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, HST, GST,
    sales, value-added, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction
    whatsoever (collectively, "Taxes”). Customer is responsible for paying all
    Taxes associated with its purchases hereunder. If ApexRMS has the legal
    obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Customer is responsible under
    this  Section, ApexRMS will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that
    amount unless  Customer provides ApexRMS with a valid tax exemption
    certificate authorized by  the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity,
    ApexRMS is solely responsible  for Taxes assessable against it based on its
    income, property and employees.
